               <h2>Exercise</h2>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q5res"> years</span> Fresh air can do wonders to our physical and mental health. The goal of walking for a 30 minutes to hour a day can  be achieved. It can also be achieved on the weekend by walking when you would normally drive. Cycling may be healthier than running because it resuce the stress on the joints. However, a long-term study showed that long-distance running among healthy older adults was not associated with osteoarthritis.  Therefore, an injury caused by long-distance running may be less common than we would expect. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-health-benefits/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a> </p>
                  <p>Every muscle of the body needs to be used frequently, because muscles grow and maintain or gain strength only in response to being 
                     challenged.  Muscles can be slightly injured and rebuilt by doing simple everyday tasks that are challenging. Muscle training need to be 
                     balanced to avoid both injuries and the slow, chronic damage that comes with ignoring pain and continuing to put stress on an injured joint.

               <article>
                  <p> <span id="add_q6res"> years</span> Most adults need between 6 and 9 hours of sleep every night.  Sleep is vital to your overall health. It is important to improve the quality of sleep Lack of sleep robs the brain of its time to recharge,
                     and that can hamper your ability to work, think, learn, get along with other people, and
                     even keep yourself safe. Sleep can also affect your weight: Too little sleep alters levels of
                     hormones that regulate hunger, which can lead to obesity.<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/sleep/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a>

               <h2>Why is it important to eat vegetables?</h2>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q7res"> years</span> Eating vegetables provides health benefits – people who eat more vegetables
                     and fruits as part of an overall healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of
                     some chronic diseases. Vegetables provide nutrients vital for health and

               <h2>Why You Need To Eat Fruit?</h2>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q8res"> years</span> Eating more fresh fruit will help you stay away from processed food. Fruit comes from nature not a factory. The closer to nature, the better for your health. Fruits are naturally low in fat, calories.

               <h2>Beans and legumes how much to consume?</h2>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q9res"> years</span> Legumes typically fit into the protein food group, since they are rich in protein as are animal meats, fish and seafood. They are commonly eaten around the world and are a rich source of fiber and B vitamins.  They are also a great replacement for meat as a source of vegetarian protein.  Beans and legumes have a number of health benefits, including reducing cholesterol, decreasing blood sugar levels and increasing healthy gut bacteria. The exact amount you should have depends on your gender. ChooseMyPlate.gov explains that women typically need at least 5 to 5½ ounce equivalents from this food group. Men can have 5½ to 6 ounce equivalents.

               <h2>How many servings of nuts and seeds?</h2>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q10res"> years</span> Nuts have been seen as heart protectors, but a recent study has even suggested that people who eat nuts daily have better health and longer lives than their counterparts who never eat nuts.  This was based on a 30-year Harvard study, supposedly the largest ever done on whether eating nuts affects our risk of death.  It has been suggestsed that nuts shouldn’t be simply added to our regular diets, they should be used to swap out unhealthy snacks.  An ounce of nuts could clock in at about 120 to 200 calories, depending on what kinds are in your hand.  If you’re watching sodium intake, it is not advisable eating salted nuts. Obviously, they shouldn’t be chocolate-covered or candied either. But overall, most preparations are fair game, including nut butters.

                     Which Kind of Nut or Seed is Best? A variety is best!.  Each nut or seed has a different nutrient profile.  A single Brazil nut has the full amount of selenium for the day. Pumpkin seeds are rich in copper and zinc, while walnuts are especially rich in manganese.  The bottom line is mix it up over the course of the week.  Pumpkin (otherwise known as pepitas), sesame and sunflower seeds are popular picks, but other tasty seeds worth a try are flaxseed, hemp and chia.

               <article>
                  <p>Scientific studies have shown that whole grains do far more to cut our risk of stroke, heart
                     disease and diabetes than refined grains.  Regularly eating whole grains can help you lower “bad” 
                     cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. A diet rich in whole grains also “is associated 
                     with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, 
                     and certain types of cancer,” says Dr. Qi Sun, at Harvard Medical School.

                  <p><span id="add_q11res"> years</span> Fish does play a key role in a healthy diet as a source of lean protein and omega-3 fats. Seaspiracy has raised concerns around whether there is such a thing as sustainable fishing.  It’s the omega-3 fatty acids, which are plentiful in many types of seafood, that offers most of the heart benefits of eating fish. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/fish-and-shellfish-nutrition/" target="_blank">Visit  NHS eat well</a>  Omega-3s are important for cell-to-cell signaling in heart muscle and for cells within the lining of the arteries. They reduce inflammation, help prevent heart rhythm abnormalities, improve the flexibility of arteries, and help lower cholesterol.

               <h3>Eat Less Red Meat
               </h3>
               <article>
                  <p><span id="add_q12res"> years</span>  In recent years, evidence has emerged that higher intakes of red meat - such as beef, lamb, pork and veal - can increase our risk of bowel cancer. Processed meats such as bacon, sausages, cured meats, pâté and corned beef have been linked to cancer too. However, it's important to remember that it is all about quality and quantity.  It is recommended that we consume below 70g of red meat. Try to have some meat-free days in the week to reduce overall consumption. Opt for other protein sources such as fish, shellfish, eggs and vegetarian proteins such as lentils, beans and soya-based products to mix things up in the week.
                    According to the World Health Organization,  eating processed meats like bacon, ham and lunch meats can
                     increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.  In the Blue Zones, people don’t eat nearly the amounts of meat that we do. We found that people there on average were eating small amounts of meat, about 2 ounces or
                     less at a time about five times per month.<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/meat-nutrition/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a>

               <h3>The sweet danger of sugar 
              </h3>
              <article>
                 <p><span id="add_q13res"> years</span>   There is increasing research to suggest that it's the sugar rather than the fat in our diets that is the major contributing factor to our obesity epidemic.  High intake of sugar causes our blood sugar levels to shoot up, giving us that feel-good 'high' followed by a crashing slump that leaves us tired, irritable and craving more sugary foods. This vicious cycle is then likely to compound other health problems. Fizzy drinks and sugary snacks have been linked to rising tooth decay in children.  'Low-fat' and 'diet' foods often contain extra sugar to help improve their taste and palatability and to add bulk and texture in place of fat.  Know your substitute. For example, xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol. These occur naturally in small amounts in plants and fruits and are often used in low-calorie products to provide sweetness but with fewer calories. Xylitol can be used in home baking as a replacement for regular sugar (ratio 1:1) although your bakes won't brown as much and xylitol can't be used where yeast is the raising agent.<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/the-sweet-danger-of-sugar" target="_blank">Visit The sweet danger of sugar</a>

                <article>
                   <p><span id="add_q14res"> years</span>   While many individuals might crave salty over sweet snacks, there are several of us with that everlasting "sweet tooth" that causes us to suddenly crave a sweet snack. Studies show that sweet cravings may be associated with low blood sugar levels and an increase in emotional stress.
                    Salty snacks like chips, pretzels and crackers are very common snacks, and we all reach for them from time to time. According to the Journal of Health Psychology, we tend to crave salty snacks when we are experiencing a hormonal fluctuation due to changes in stress levels. Another study shows that salty cravings may be a result of dehydration. Satisfying your salty cravings can give your body some much-needed nutrients. A few healthier salty snack options may include nuts, whole-wheat crackers, or popcorn sprinkled with a little sea salt.

                     <p><span id="add_q15res"> years</span>   Throughout the 10,000 or so years that humans have been drinking fermented beverages, they’ve also been arguing about their merits and demerits. The debate still simmers today, with a lively back-and-forth over whether alcohol is good for you or bad for you.  Moderate drinking seems to be good for the heart and circulatory system, and probably protects against type 2 diabetes and gallstones. Heavy drinking is a major cause of preventable death in most countries.  Moderation is key.  <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/drinks-to-consume-in-moderation/alcohol-full-story/" target="_blank">Visit The Nutrition Source- Balancing Risks and Benefits of Alcohol</a>

               </h3>
               <article>
                  <p> Research suggests that strong friendships may lead to a longer life. That certainly seems
                     true in the world’s Blue Zones, where social connectedness is the traditional norm. In
                     Japan, they have a name for close-knit circles of friends who lean on each other for
                     support throughout their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It makes sense when we think about the things our friends do for us. As the 
                     notes, friends take an interest in our health and well-being, increase our happiness and
                     reduce stress, help us cope with trauma and drama in our lives, and boost our sense of
                     purpose, which is also among the secrets to longevity in the Blue Zones.
                     Nurture the friendships you have, especially the ones with healthy, happy
                     people. <a href="https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-living/wellbeing/news/a27658/friends-key-to-living-longer/" target="_blank">Visit Net Doctor</a>

               <article>
                  <p> The one Blue Zone in the U.S. is in Loma Linda, California, which includes a cluster of
                     christians. Much of their lifestyle include healthier plant-based diets, no smoking,
                     pursuit of a strong sense of purpose are likely contributors to their longevity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     But it’s also likely that routinely gathering together in faith leads to their longer lives. Most of Blue Zones centenarians we interviewed were part of a
                     faith-based community. Attending a religious service can foster what
                     scientists call “social integration.” Building a strong social network of both family and
                     friends has been shown to foster good mental and physical health. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322175" target="_blank">Visit Medical News Today</a>
