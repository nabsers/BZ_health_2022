          <h2>Exercise</h2>
          <article>
            <p>The goal of walking for a 30 minutes to hour a day can  be achieved. It can also be achieved on the weekend by walking when you would 
              normally drive. Cycling may be healthier than running because it resuce the stress on the joints. However, a long-term study showed that 
              long-distance running among healthy older adults was not associated with osteoarthritis.  Therefore, an injury caused by long-distance 
              running may be less common than we would expect. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-health-benefits/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a> </p>

            <p>Every muscle of the body needs to be used frequently, because muscles grow and maintain or gain strength only in response to being 
              challenged.  Muscles can be slightly injured and rebuilt by doing simple everyday tasks that are challenging. Muscle training need to be 
              balanced to avoid both injuries and the slow, chronic damage that comes with ignoring pain and continuing to put stress on an injured joint. </p>

          <h2>Whole Grains</h2>
          <article>
            <p>Scientific studies have shown that whole grains do far more to cut our risk of stroke, heart
                disease and diabetes than refined grains.  Regularly eating whole grains can help you lower “bad” 
                cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. A diet rich in whole grains also “is associated 
                with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, 
                and certain types of cancer,” says Dr. Qi Sun, at Harvard Medical School.

          <h3>Sleep Well
          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>Sleep is vital to your overall health.  Lack of sleep robs the brain of its time to recharge,
                and that can hamper your ability to work, think, learn, get along with other people, and
                even keep yourself safe. Sleep can also affect your weight: Too little sleep alters levels of
                hormones that regulate hunger, which can lead to obesity.<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/sleep/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a>
                How much sleep do you need? It is recommended that we get between 7 and 9 hours a night.

          <h3>Eat Less Red Meat
          </h3>
          <article>
            <p> According to the World Health Organization,  eating processed meats like bacon, ham and lunch meats can
                increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/meat-nutrition/" target="_blank">Visit NHS UK</a>
                
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Blue Zones, people don’t eat nearly the amounts of meat that we do. We
                found that people there on average were eating small amounts of meat, about 2 ounces or
                less at a time about five times per month.
              </p>
          </article>

          <h3>Be Friendly
          </h3>
          <article>
            <p> Research suggests that strong friendships may lead to a longer life. That certainly seems
                true in the world’s Blue Zones, where social connectedness is the traditional norm. In
                Japan, they have a name for close-knit circles of friends who lean on each other for
                support throughout their lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                It makes sense when we think about the things our friends do for us. As the 
                notes, friends take an interest in our health and well-being, increase our happiness and
                reduce stress, help us cope with trauma and drama in our lives, and boost our sense of
                purpose, which is also among the secrets to longevity in the Blue Zones.
                Nurture the friendships you have, especially the ones with healthy, happy
                people. <a href="https://www.netdoctor.co.uk/healthy-living/wellbeing/news/a27658/friends-key-to-living-longer/" target="_blank">Visit Net Doctor</a>

          <h3>Have Faith
          </h3>
          <article>
              <p> The one Blue Zone in the U.S. is in Loma Linda, California, which includes a cluster of
                  christians. Much of their lifestyle include healthier plant-based diets, no smoking,
                  pursuit of a strong sense of purpose are likely contributors to their longevity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But it’s also likely that routinely gathering together in faith leads to their longer lives. Most of Blue Zones centenarians we interviewed were part of a
                  faith-based community. Attending a religious service can foster what
                  scientists call “social integration.” Building a strong social network of both family and
                  friends has been shown to foster good mental and physical health. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322175" target="_blank">Visit Medical News Today</a>
